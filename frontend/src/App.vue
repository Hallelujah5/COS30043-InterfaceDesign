<!-- This is the root component of your application. It replaces `App.jsx`. -->
<!-- It contains the main layout and the <router-view> which displays the current page. -->

  <!-- that injects itself into the app, so it doesn't need to be placed here. -->

  <!-- for the current route. It's the equivalent of <Routes> in React. -->
  <router-view />

// This component is very simple and may not even need a script section
// if it's only holding the router-view.
